Nucleon-Nucleon Scattering Calculator, written in C++.

Phase shifts are calculated by solving LS equation with matrix inversion method in momentum space. Two-body states are defined by SYM-LSJ convention, under which matrix elements are calculated.

The evaluation of interaction matrix elements are by aPWD method.
